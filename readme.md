# Route Records Parser
- A simple route records parser I made for CS 1713
- Parses a given csv file and dynamically allocates memory for the contents.
- Allows the user to search the block of memory for their desired option

## User can search by the following options:
- Route
- Origin Airport
- Destination Airport
- Airline Code 

# Running the file
```bash
make &
./flight.exe data.csv
```
